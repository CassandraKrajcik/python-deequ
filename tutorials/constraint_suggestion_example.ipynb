    "# Automatic Suggestion of Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "In our experience, a major hurdle in data validation is that someone needs to come up with the actual constraints to apply on the data. This can be very difficult for large, real-world datasets, especially if they are very complex and contain information from a lot of different sources. We build so-called constraint suggestion functionality into deequ to assist users in finding reasonable constraints for their data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our constraint suggestion first [profiles the data](./data_profiling_example.ipynb) and then applies a set of heuristic rules to suggest constraints. In the following, we give a concrete example on how to have constraints suggested for your data."

    "Currently, we leave it up to the user to decide whether they want to apply the suggested constraints or not, and provide the corresponding Scala code for convenience. For larger datasets, it makes sense to evaluate the suggested constraints on some held-out portion of the data to see whether they hold or not. You can test this by adding an invocation of .useTrainTestSplitWithTestsetRatio(0.1) to the ConstraintSuggestionRunner. With this configuration, it would compute constraint suggestions on 90% of the data and evaluate the suggested constraints on the remaining 10%.\n",
